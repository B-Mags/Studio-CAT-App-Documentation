# What is Studio CAT?

Think of a library's card catalog. Studio CAT is a digital catalog of every title stored in the Recorded Books studio. It's split into two libraries: the Recorded Books Library and the BookaVivo Library.   

Studio CAT is built to show you each title's data, such as its runtime and file count, the studio where it was recorded, the author and narrator, etc. It's other primary function is to tell you where each title's corresponding audio files are stored. That means no more searching through a handful of drives! Simply search the title in Studio CAT, and it will tell you what audio versions are available and where to look for the files. 

 ## Views

 Views in studio cat are simply displays of specific sets of information. The default view is the library view. This view displays the title ID, title, author, narrator, and status of each book in the database. This, however, is not the only data available for each title. The way you view data in Studio CAT is completely customizable. In the “Views” menu, you may select one of several premade views, such as Author View, Library View, Studio View, etc., or you may create your own view with specified data pertinent to your needs. 

 
### To customize your view:

1. Click “edit columns” in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Click “Add Columns.” This will open a window with all available data.
3. Click which columns you'd like to add to your view.
4. Once you've finished adding columns, click “Close.”
5. Reorder your columns by dragging and dropping their labels.
6. Once finished, click “Apply.” 

 
### If you would like to save this new view for later use: 

1. Click the view menu (which now has an asterisk by it).
2. Click "Save As New View."
3. Name your new view, then click save.

## Using Filters

## Exporting Reports

There are a number of reports Studio Cat can generate for you, which group titles based on given criteria. These reports are helpful when, for example, you need to see all titles written by a specific author or all titles recorded by a specific studio. It's also useful for more detailed reporting. For example, Studio CAT can generate the upload reports we typically have to create by hand to send to HQ. All reports can be exported to excel.
